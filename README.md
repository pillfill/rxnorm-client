#PillFill RxNorm Client

 This project is working to create a lightweight REST Java/Android client library for the [RxNav APIs](http://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/APIsOverview.html), services managed by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) &  National Institutes of Health (NIH). While we're unabashed fans of the services, please note this project **has no affiliation with NLM, NIH, or HHS**.

##Why?

 The RxNav API suite is a great drug information resource. It'd be a wonderful tool for many mHealth apps.

 The method endorsed by RxNav to [build WSDL client stubs](http://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/RxNormAPIMakeApp.html) for their SOAP interface, however, is painful and doesn't work well for most mobile platforms. Several years ago we tried to force a WSDL client onto Android anyway, eventually abandoning the idea after plenty of frustration. It now appears that [we were in good company](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5461127/using-jaxb-with-google-android).

 It's also important to note that there's no separate schema for the underlying drug data since datamodels, bindings, etc are [all baked into WSDL definitions](http://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/RxNormDBService.xml)). There are [database schema/RRF files](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/docs/rxnormfiles.html), but they aren't terribly helpful since the service bindings we're interested in appear to be Javaâ†’WSDL generated.

##Strategy

 So this project was started to (slowly) build an RxNorm REST client with development broken it into two separate efforts:

 1. Define Separate Data Schemas

 I'm transcribing the available information from the WSDL definition and REST service responses into JSON Schema documents. [These schema documents](https://github.com/pillfill/rxnorm-client/tree/master/src/main/resources/schemas) are then used to generate Java POJO objects via [jsonschema2pojo](https://github.com/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo/). We're taking this databinding approach with the intention to make the JSON Schemas reusable across other languages and platforms (though this library will remain Android/Java focused).

 2. Create Service Proxies

 Once we've made good progress on the data bindings, we'll also build include some lightweight service proxies to simplify interaction with the RxNav REST services. This should be the (relatively) easy part!


That said, we'll try to stick to a few principles along the way:

 * Minimize external runtime dependencies- Currently only the Gson library.
 * Keep the library focused on the data schemas and basic service proxies.
 * Unit test using JSON documents captured from the live RxNav service.
 * Integration test using the real RxNav service endpoints (lightly though to not violate RxNav's ToS).
 * Depend on schemas to generate databinding objects in order to maximize reusability.
 * Try to provide a clear mapping to the [RxNav service documentation](http://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/APIsOverview.html).


##Current Status

 We have a subset of JSON schemas defined and unit tested for the RxNorm, NDFRT, and Interaction services.

 None of the service proxies have been built yet, but I currently plan to use the Gson library to manage deserialization of data received from the REST services.

 Want to contribute? Pull requests are certainly encouraged!


##Building and Use

 The project is gradle based:

 `./gradlew clean build`

 This will cause the datamodel objects to be purged and regenerated in `src/gen/java`, also rerunning all unit tests. It should build a jar file in the `build/libs` directory, making integration with other projects easier. Note that many of the schemas are still being created and/or optimized and you should **expect frequent breaking changes for now**. We'll create a stable branch and release to maven central once we get most of the basic service proxies created and tested.
